          The <strong>Carolina Reaper</strong>, officially the hottest chili pepper in the world, was bred by Ed Currie of the PuckerButt Pepper Company in South Carolina. It holds the Guinness World Record with an average heat of 1.6 million Scoville Heat Units (SHU), with some specimens reaching over 2.2 million SHU!

          This fireball of flavor is a cross between a Pakistani Naga and a Red Habanero. Despite its inferno-like heat, the Reaper has a surprisingly sweet, fruity taste — if your tongue survives long enough to notice.

          Used in extreme hot sauces, spicy eating contests, and dares that often end in regret, the Carolina Reaper is more than a chili — it’s a test of human endurance.
