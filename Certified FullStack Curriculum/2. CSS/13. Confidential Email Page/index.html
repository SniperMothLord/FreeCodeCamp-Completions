    <p>
      Deep beneath the surface of Europa, hidden in a glacial cavern warmed by alien technology, lies the Arc-Catalyst—an ancient weapon rumored to predate even the first stars. Encased in obsidian armor and humming with quantum resonance, it doesn't just destroy matter—it <span class="blurred">erases the probability of it ever existing.</span> Earth’s black ops divisions call it "The Ghost Pulse," though no operative who's seen it in action has returned with a clear memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recovered during <span class="blurred">a silent skirmish with a rogue Martian outpost</span>, the Arc-Catalyst emits pulses that render conventional physics meaningless in a radius of 200 meters. Bullets curve, time stutters, and language collapses into raw emotion. Some scientists believe it’s powered by sentient dark matter; others insist it's a prison, not a weapon—meant to keep something far worse inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently housed in a zero-contact stasis vault at <span class="blurred">Site Theta-12</span>, the weapon is guarded by AI constructs with no human oversight. Only one person holds the access code: a linguist who accidentally activated the device by speaking an extinct Sumerian dialect during a routine analysis. She hasn’t spoken since.
